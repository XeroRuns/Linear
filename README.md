# Linear
A simple linear algebra library written in rust

# Usage
We have integrated test and a simple usage cage in src/main.rs, but you can read through all the functions in the src/lib.rs file if you want to use any.

## How to run those tests
Simply just do
```cargo run``` and that will give you an output of the usage

# Why
Wanted to freshen up some of my alegbra skills for future projects
